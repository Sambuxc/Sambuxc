🛹  Fun fact: I skateboard and ride inline rollerskates


#### How did I get into Web Dev?

I saw a niche market in a multi-massive online chatting community (MMOCC) game called Habbo Hotel in the early 2000s and decided to create fansites for myself and other players. I designed, coded and hosted their websites and provided shoutcast radios so that visitors could enjoy music whilst exploring webpage content.

#### What is the most important thing to me?

• Delivering small and large projects

• Code reviewing

• Code documentation

• Simplification of code

• Having fun doing it

• Helping others

• Skating
